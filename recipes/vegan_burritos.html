        <h3>Want to know how to make them! Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/4 cups water </li>
            <li>1 cup uncooked brown rice</li>
            <li>Lots of other things wink wink</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Time for STEPS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>Bring water and brown rice to a boil in a saucepan. Stir in diced tomatoes with chile peppers. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 50 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>While rice is cooking, mix cumin, turmeric, basil, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and seasoned salt together in a large bowl. Add olive oil. Toss potatoes in the mixture until well coated. Lay potatoes in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until fork-tender, 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the size of the cubes, checking halfway through cooking time and flipping over as needed.
            </li>
            <li>While potatoes are cooking, heat a skillet over medium heat. Saute bell pepper and onion in the hot pan until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Heat black beans in a saucepan over medium-low heat until hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Keep warm.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat tortillas in a separate skillet over low heat until warm, 1 to 2 minutes, or according to package instructions.
            </li>
            <li>Lay out tortillas and fill as desired with cooked rice, beans, potatoes, pepper-onion mixture, spinach, romaine lettuce, and salsa as desired. Wrap up into burritos and serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
